# Multi-Tier Web Application Using Kubernetes and Docker

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a multi-tier web application deployed using Kubernetes on Azure (AKS). The application is written in Go and utilizes Redis for storage, featuring a master-replica architecture for high availability. It is containerized using Docker and orchestrated via Kubernetes, showcasing modern DevOps practices with GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and Super-Linter to ensure code quality and security.

## Key Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Go
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (AKS)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Database**: Redis (Master and Replicas)

## Tools and Practices
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates CI/CD workflows, ensuring continuous integration and deployment.
- **Dependabot**: Automatically updates dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Super-Linter**: Enforces a consistent code style and detects code quality issues across multiple programming languages.

## Application Deployment
The application is deployed on Azure and can be accessed through a public IP, demonstrating a live implementation of the architecture described.

## Security and Compliance
Integration of Dependabot and Super-Linter in the GitHub repository ensures that the application is not only up to date with the latest dependencies but also adheres to coding best practices and security standards.
